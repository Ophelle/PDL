							<label>John McCain believes that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental, individual Constitutional right.  In the past he has voted to protect gun manufacturers from attempts to make them liable for crimes committed by third parties. McCain opposes restrictions on assault rifles and has voted against such bans. He has supported legislation requiring gun manufacturers to include gun safety devices such as trigger lock in product packaging. He cosponsored legislation to lift the DC gun ban. McCain has opposed "waiting periods" for the purchase of firearms. McCain also voted against the 1993 Brady Bill to restrict the availability of handguns. :</label></br>
